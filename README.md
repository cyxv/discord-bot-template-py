# discord-bot-template-py

I was getting kinda sick of seeing garbage YouTube tutorials that describe the very basics but fail to explain how cogs work and how useful they are. This one is probably better, but if you don't know how to code in Python, I'd recommend learning that first.

You can use this template for whatever you want (MIT license, so you can make it commercial if you really want to). It's extremely basic, but if you're relatively proficient in Python then this should explain what you need to know, and you can get the rest from the documentation.
